# SSYP_2017_Queens

This is my educational project from Summer School Of Young Programmers. This project use genetic algorithm for solving the problem of N Queens. For more information about this problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

Compile with a compiler of your choice (checked on g++ and clang). Number of queens (N) is hardcoded, but can be found in the defines. When run, the program waits for an input of the population size.
